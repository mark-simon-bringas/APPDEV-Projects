                "comment": "I had high hopes for this keyboard, but I was quite disappointed. The keys are soft but feel unresponsive at times, especially during typing sessions that require more pressure. After a few weeks of use, the keys started to feel even more mushy, and I began to notice some issues with key registration. Itâ€™s okay for casual typing, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who types a lot or needs precision. The build quality is decent, but the overall typing experience left me wanting more. If you're looking for a membrane keyboard thatâ€™s responsive and reliable, Iâ€™d suggest looking elsewhere."
